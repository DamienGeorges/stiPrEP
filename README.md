## Incidence of Gonorrhea and Chlamydia Following HIV Preexposure Prophylaxis among Men Who Have Sex with Men: A Modeling Study

This repository holds the source to code to reproduce the analysis featured in our Gonorrhea (GC) and Chlamydia (CT) transmission model among men who have sex with men in the United States. This study investigated the relationship between the scale of HIV preexposure prophylaxis (PREP) and STI incidence in US MSM, to understand the causal questions and public health implications surrounding the potentially countervailing phenomena of increased behavioral risk with PrEP-uptake and additional screening and treatment of STIs after PrEP initiation.

These models are written and executed in the R statistical software language. To run these files, it is necessary to first install our epidemic modeling software, [EpiModel](http://epimodel.org/), and our extension package specifically for modeling HIV and STI transmission dynamics among MSM, [EpiModelHIV](http://github.com/statnet/EpiModelHIV).

In R:
```
install.packages("EpiModel")

# install devtools if necessary, install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("statnet/tergmLite")
devtools::install_github("statnet/EpiModelHIV", ref = "prep-sti")
```

## Abstract

### Background
Preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is highly effective for preventing HIV, but modest levels of risk compensation (RC) among men who have sex with men (MSM) have raised concerns about increased incidence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). CDCâ€™s PrEP guidelines recommend biannual STI screening, which may reduce incidence by treating STIs that would otherwise remain undiagnosed. We used modeling to estimate the effect of these two potentially counteracting phenomena.

### Methods
With a mathematical model of rectal and urogenital Neisseria gonorrhoeae (GC) and Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) among MSM, we simulated PrEP uptake following the prescription indications and HIV/STI screening recommendations in the CDC guidelines. Model scenarios varied PrEP coverage (the proportion of MSM indicated for PrEP who received it), RC (as a reduction in the probability of condom use), and the STI screening interval.

### Results
Under 40% PrEP coverage and 40% RC, 42% of GC infections and 40% of CT infections would be averted over the next decade. A doubling of RC would still result in net STI prevention benefits relative to no PrEP. Incidence declined because PrEP-related STI screening resulted in a 17% and 16% increase in the treatment of asymptomatic and rectal STIs, respectively. Screening and timely treatment at quarterly vs biannual intervals would reduce STI incidence a further 50%.

### Conclusions
Implementation of the CDC PrEP guidelines while scaling up coverage could result in a significant decline in STI incidence among MSM. Our study highlights the design of PrEP not only as daily antiretroviral medication, but as a combination HIV/STI prevention package incorporating STI screening and treatment.
